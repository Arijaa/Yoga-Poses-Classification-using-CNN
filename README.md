# Yoga Poses Classification using CNN üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüñºÔ∏è

Hey there, yogi! Ready to dive into the world of automated yoga pose classification? Let's flow through this README and explore how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can help us master the art of identifying yoga poses from images.

## Introduction
Yoga is not just about striking a pose; it's about finding balance and harmony within yourself. With this project, we're bringing the power of deep learning to the mat to automatically recognize and classify various yoga poses. Get ready to take your practice to the next level!

## Problem Statement
Have you ever wished for an AI-powered yoga instructor? Well, that's what we're aiming for! Our mission is to create a model that can accurately identify different yoga poses from images. Whether it's Warrior I or Downward Dog, our model will have you covered.

## Model Architecture
Picture this: layers of neural networks working together like a well-choreographed yoga sequence. Our CNN architecture is designed to capture the intricate details and nuances of each yoga pose, helping us achieve accurate classification with ease.

## Training and Evaluation
Just like mastering a challenging pose, our model undergoes rigorous training to reach its full potential. We'll sweat it out with the training dataset and fine-tune our model until it's ready to gracefully flow through the testing dataset. Get ready to see those accuracy metrics soar!

## Results
Drumroll, please! Our trained model shines bright like a yogi in savasana, achieving high accuracy on the testing dataset. From Tree Pose to Crow Pose, our model flawlessly identifies each yoga pose, paving the way for a new era of automated pose recognition.

## Conclusion
And there you have it, folks! With the power of CNN, we've unlocked a whole new realm of possibilities in the world of yoga. Whether you're a seasoned yogi or a curious beginner, our model is here to guide you on your journey to zen. Roll out your mat, strike a pose, and let's flow together!
